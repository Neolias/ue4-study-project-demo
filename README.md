# UE4 Study Project Demo

![Gym](Gym.png)

Hello! I started working on this study project as a part of an Unreal Engine 4 course ([XYZ School](https://www.school-xyz.com/main_eng)) in the beginning of 2024. Using the knowledge gained during the course and my independent learning, I improved it and extended most of the features.

Implemented features:
- Character movement
- Character camera and animations
- Character abilities coordinated and replicated using GAS
- Equipment and inventory systems
- Player HUD and inventory/equipment UI
- Full replication of characters and their inventories
- Simple turret and character AI
- Game saves and level streaming
- Online subsystem
